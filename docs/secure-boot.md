You **can technically re-enable Secure Boot**, but **not without extra work** ‚Äî and in most cases, **it's better to leave it disabled** if you're using the NVIDIA proprietary `.run` driver.

### üîí Why Secure Boot Breaks NVIDIA `.run`

Secure Boot requires that **kernel modules be signed** with a trusted key. The official `.run` installer from NVIDIA:

* Builds out-of-tree kernel modules
* **Does NOT sign them**
* So when Secure Boot is re-enabled, the kernel **silently refuses to load the NVIDIA driver**, even if everything else appears to work

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Leave Secure Boot Disabled (Recommended)

If you're not dual-booting Windows with BitLocker or relying on Secure Boot for enterprise compliance, this is the simplest option.

### üõ†Ô∏è Option 2: Enable Secure Boot + Sign the NVIDIA Kernel Module Manually

If you *must* have Secure Boot enabled, here's an outline of what you'd need to do:

#### 1. Generate your own MOK (Machine Owner Key)

```bash
openssl req -new -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout MOK.key -out MOK.crt -nodes -days 36500 -subj "/CN=My NVIDIA MOK/"
```

#### 2. Enroll the key using `mokutil`

```bash
sudo mokutil --import MOK.crt
```

You'll set a password and reboot to enter the MOK manager to approve it.

#### 3. Sign the NVIDIA kernel module manually

After the driver is installed and built:

```bash
sudo /usr/src/linux-headers-$(uname -r)/scripts/sign-file sha256 MOK.key MOK.crt $(modinfo -n nvidia)
```

You‚Äôd need to repeat this **after every kernel or NVIDIA update**.

### üß© Bottom Line

| Use Case                 | Recommendation                                                             |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Regular desktop use      | ‚úÖ Leave Secure Boot **disabled**                                           |
| Enterprise compliance    | üõ†Ô∏è Set up manual signing or use `dkms` + signed drivers via packages      |
| Dual-boot with BitLocker | Only enable Secure Boot if necessary and prepared to handle module signing |

If you want, I can help write an Ansible role to automate MOK generation and signing ‚Äî though it‚Äôs still not 100% headless due to the reboot + MOK enrollment UI.
